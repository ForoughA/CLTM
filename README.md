# CLTM: 
## Conditional Latent Tree Models for prediction of dynamic social networks.
Please visit our [Project page](http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/CLTM.html) for more detail:

Look at this [blog post](https://blog.terminal.com/learning-latent-group-dynamics-for-prediction-of-high-dimensional-time-series/) for a description of the project:

Check out [visualization1](http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/Projects_sub/CLTM/dynamicTree.html) and [visualization2](http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/Projects_sub/CLTM/stdPerformance.html) for a better understanding of the model.
